  abstract  = "In the last few decades many methods have become available for
               forecasting. As always, when alternatives exist, choices need to
               be made so that an appropriate forecasting method can be
               selected and used for the specific situation being considered.
               This paper reports the results of a forecasting competition that
               provides information to facilitate such choice. Seven experts in
               each of the 24 methods forecasted up to 1001 series for six up
               to eighteen time horizons. The results of the competition are
               presented in this paper whose purpose is to provide empirical
               evidence about differences found to exist among the various
               extrapolative (time series) methods used in the competition.",
